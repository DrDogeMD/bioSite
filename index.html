        <p>Yoni Gill is one of my close friends. I first met him at middle school in 2007, where I knew him as Jon Gill. He is originally 
        from Israel, and when he moved to the United States, his parents put his name as Jonathan instead of Yonatan, which he has since changed back.</p>

        <p>After high school, I joined the Marines while Yoni went on to college and studied photography. While in the Marines, I got stationed in Hawaii. 
        Being in such a beautiful place, I wanted all of my friends to come and visit me. Yoni came and visited me; however, I had no idea he was coming. 
        I had other friends coming to visit and they planned to surprise me. Yoni came a day or two earlier and got picked up from the airport by my wife 
        and went around and rang the doorbell instead of coming in with her when they arrived. I was the one who answered, I first looked through the eye 
        glass in the door and though “This guy looks like Yoni,” and when I opened the door and realized it was actually him I had no idea what to say, 
        needless to say I think that is the most surprised I have ever been in my life.

        <p>Yoni now owns his own photography company and does various types of photography but mostly weddings. You can visit his site here,
        <a href='http://www.yonigill.com/'>Yoni Gill Photography</a> While his photography company is doing well, he also is starting a wood working company 
        called Yoni Made. He has made desks, a coffee and dining table, and a bed frame for himself but has only made smaller things like cutting boards that
        are currently being sold as he is still learning. I have been to his shop a couple times and have helped him with some of his woodworking. He has invested 
        a lot in good equipment and has become good at it in a short amount of time, where I can hardly cut things straight.
